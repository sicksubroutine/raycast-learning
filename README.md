# RAYCAST LEARNING CORNER! COME AND JOIN THE PARTY! (Or not)
This is a project where I am learning more about Raycasting for video games.

Based upon the tutorial on Youtube by *Code Monkey King* found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssm2jMd40p4&t).

He has left the tutorial incomplete so this project will be dedicated to progressing my knowledge on raycasting in HTML5/Javascript and maybe in other enviroments like SDL2/C++.

My research here is inspired by: 
* John Carmack's early start with raycasting in the Wolfenstien 3D engine.
* Related media like [Game Engine Black Book for Wolfenstein 3D by Fabien Sanglard](https://smile.amazon.com/Game-Engine-Black-Book-Wolfenstein/dp/1539692876).
* [Poom (Pico 8 version of Doom)](https://freds72.itch.io/poom) by [Frederic Souchu](https://twitter.com/FSouchu). (Hopefully I can get to binary space paritioning soon! haha)
