# [RAYCAST LEARNING CORNER! COME AND JOIN THE PARTY!](https://github.com/sicksubroutine/raycast-learning)
This is a project where I am learning more about Raycasting for video games.

Based upon the tutorial on Youtube by *Code Monkey King* found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssm2jMd40p4&t).

He has left the tutorial incomplete so the progress of this project is dependent upon my exploration from here!

Current goals of the project:

* Try to truly learn and understand the Raycasting math. Be able to reproduce the code without needing to reply on rebuilt code snippets.
* Have a project where I finish the "game" by adding a couple more parts of the basic Wolf 3D game. Sprites, opening doors, maybe basic combat.
* Improve my competency with Javascript and the syntax used in the linked Github repo. 
* Longer term goal could be to port the project from Javascript to something like C++.

My research here is inspired by: 
* John Carmack's early start with raycasting in the Wolfenstien 3D engine.
* Related media like [Game Engine Black Book for Wolfenstein 3D by Fabien Sanglard](https://smile.amazon.com/Game-Engine-Black-Book-Wolfenstein/dp/1539692876).
* [Poom (Pico 8 version of Doom)](https://freds72.itch.io/poom) by [Frederic Souchu](https://twitter.com/FSouchu). (Hopefully I can get to binary space paritioning soon! haha)
